# data_dashboard

This project provides a simple JS-based data-dashboard as a Drupal 7 module. The module has been made specifically for [daten.berlin.de](http://daten.berlin.de), Berlin's Open Data Portal, but could be used in other Drupal sites as well.

The dashboard itself is based on Thomas Tursic's [Datenwaben](https://github.com/tursics/data-dashboard), which have been stripped of the navigation elements and reduced to one city.
